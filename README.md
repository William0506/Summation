### python part
Can only be executed using your own IDE or convert them to executable file.Remember to change the file address on the first line.
B.txt:Original Bernoulli number numerical library.
SPHAmod.py:Module for SPHA calculations.
Summation_R/C/SPHA.py:Calculate Summation where the power is R/C/SPHA.Need to introduce SPHAmod.
Summation&mod_SPHA.py:Calculate Summation where the power is SPHA.No need to introduce SPHAmod.

### C++ part
.cpp files can only be executed using your own IDE.If you don't have an IDE, download the executable files and execute them.
B.cpp/exe:A program for calculating Bernoulli numbers.
B.txt:Original Bernoulli number numerical library.
SPHAmod.cpp/h:Module for SPHA calculations.
Summation_SPHA.cpp/exe:Calculate Summation where the power is SPHA.Need to introduce SPHAmod.
Summation&mod_SPHA.cpp/exe:Calculate Summation where the power is SPHA.No need to introduce SPHAmod.

### HTML part
